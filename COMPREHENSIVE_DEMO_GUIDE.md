## Technical Implementation Showcase

### Code Quality & Architecture

#### Real-Time WebSocket Implementation
```typescript
// Live voting with fraud detection
const handleVoteSubmit = useCallback(async (submissionId: string, voteData: any) => {
  // Optimistic update for instant feedback
  setUserVotes(prev => ({ ...prev, [submissionId]: voteData }))
  
  // Real-time vote emission
  emit('cast_vote', {
    competitionId: competition.id,
    submissionId,
    voteData
  })
  
  // Listen for fraud detection alerts
  socket.on('fraud_alert', (alert) => {
    if (alert.severity === 'high') {
      showToast.warning('Suspicious activity detected')
    }
  })
}, [])
```

#### Quadratic Voting Algorithm
```typescript
// Credit-based voting with quadratic cost
const calculateVoteCost = (votes: number): number => {
  return Math.pow(votes, 2) // Quadratic scaling
}

const remainingCredits = budget - submissions.reduce((total, submission) => {
  const votes = userVotes[submission.id] || 0
  return total + calculateVoteCost(votes)
}, 0)
```

#### AI Fraud Detection
```python
# Multi-dimensional anomaly detection
class FraudDetector:
    def analyze_voting_pattern(self, votes, user_context):
        suspicion_score = 0
        
        # IP clustering analysis
        if self.detect_ip_clustering(votes):
            suspicion_score += 30
            
        # Temporal pattern analysis  
        if self.detect_rapid_voting(votes):
            suspicion_score += 25
            
        # Behavioral consistency
        if self.detect_behavioral_anomaly(votes, user_context):
            suspicion_score += 20
            
        return {
            'score': suspicion_score,
            'severity': self.get_severity_level(suspicion_score),
