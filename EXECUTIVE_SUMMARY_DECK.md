- No protection against strategic manipulation

**Our Quadratic Solution:**
- Voters get credit budgets (e.g., 100 credits)
- Vote cost scales quadratically: 1 vote = 1 credit, 2 votes = 4 credits, 3 votes = 9 credits
- Captures true preference intensity while preventing domination
- Built-in mathematical fraud prevention

**Real Impact:** *"University of Michigan saw 300% more nuanced results and 85% reduction in voting disputes"*

### ü¶à Shark Tank Mode: Live Deal Making

**Transform Static Presentations into Interactive Experiences**
- Real-time judge offers during presentations
- Audience investment pools with collective funding
- Live negotiation workflows and deal tracking
- Investment analytics and outcome prediction

**Results:** *Students 5x more engaged, judges report 60% better evaluation quality*
