## ‚úÖ **Post-Deployment Verification**

### **Test the New Endpoints**

Run these curl commands to verify deployment:

**1. Judge Analytics Enhanced**:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://nestfestdash.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/judge-analytics-enhanced?dateRange=30" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer development-bypass-token" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

**Expected Response**: `200 OK` with comprehensive analytics data

**2. Judge Conflict Resolution**:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://nestfestdash.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/judge-conflict-resolution?scope=all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer development-bypass-token"
```

**Expected Response**: `200 OK` with conflict detection results

**3. Judge Workload Balancer**:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://nestfestdash.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/judge-workload-balancer?includeRecommendations=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer development-bypass-token"
```

**Expected Response**: `200 OK` with workload analysis and recommendations

### **Run Automated Test Suite**:
```bash
node test-enhanced-judge-apis.js
```

**Expected Result**: `3/3 tests passed (100% success rate)`

## üìã **Function Dependencies**

### **Required Node.js Packages**
All required packages are already included in the existing `package.json`:

- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Database operations
- `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing
- Built-in Node.js modules: `crypto`, `https`, `url`

### **Environment Variables**
Ensure these are configured in Netlify:

- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` - Google Sheets ID (fallback)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service key

### **Database Schema**
The functions use the existing Supabase schema:
- `judges` table
- `votes` table  
- `judge_assignments` table
- `voting_sessions` table
- All existing indexes and views
