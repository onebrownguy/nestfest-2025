## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Real-Time Architecture
```typescript
// WebSocket-based live voting with optimistic updates
const handleVoteSubmit = async (submissionId: string, voteData: any) => {
  // Instant UI feedback
  setUserVotes(prev => ({ ...prev, [submissionId]: voteData }))
  
  // Real-time vote broadcasting
  emit('cast_vote', { competitionId, submissionId, voteData })
  
  // Fraud detection integration
  socket.on('fraud_alert', handleFraudAlert)
}
```

### Quadratic Voting Innovation
```typescript
// Credit-based preference intensity calculation
const calculateVoteCost = (votes: number): number => {
  return Math.pow(votes, 2) // Quadratic scaling prevents domination
}
```

### AI Fraud Detection
```python
# Multi-dimensional anomaly detection
class FraudDetector:
    def analyze_voting_pattern(self, votes, context):
        score = self.detect_ip_clustering(votes) * 0.3
        score += self.detect_rapid_voting(votes) * 0.25  
        score += self.detect_behavioral_anomaly(votes) * 0.2
        return {'score': score, 'severity': self.get_severity(score)}
```
